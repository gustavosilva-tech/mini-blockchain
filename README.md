Project: Mini Blockchain in Java
Features:
Creation of chained blocks
Each block has:
-Index
-Timestamp
-Data (simulated transaction)
-Hash of the current block
-Hash of the previous block

Chain validation (checks if the blockchain is valid)


# Why is this project useful?

-It helps to understand how the basis of a real blockchain (such as Bitcoin or Ethereum) works.

-It shows how to ensure data integrity without relying on a central database.

-It serves as a basis for more complex applications (e.g., cryptocurrencies, digital records, smart contracts).
